# Add-Delta-Smoothing-Jeffrey-s-Law-
This provides more accurate results as compared to lidstone's law and add one smoothing techniques

**Formula:**

p(w1,w2...wn) = μ x C(w1 w2 ... wn)/N + ((1 − μ)/V)
μ = N / N + delta * V
V -> Vocabulary
c(w1,w2...wn) -> probability of occurance of (w1,w2...wn) together
N -> c(w1,w2....wn-1)
